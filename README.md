# 🚁 Drone-Based Flood Detection and Segmentation using Deep Learning

🚀 A deep learning-based system that detects and segments flood-affected regions from drone imagery using a U-Net model and a Flask web interface.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on automated flood detection using aerial images captured by drones. It leverages a U-Net convolutional neural network to perform pixel-wise segmentation and identify flooded regions accurately.

A user-friendly web application is developed using Flask, allowing users to:

* Register and log in
* Upload drone images
* View segmentation results in real time

This solution is useful for disaster response teams and environmental monitoring systems.
